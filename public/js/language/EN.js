    //风险声明
    risk_section_title:"Risk Factors",
    risk_section_abstract:"Blockchain technology is an innovative technology. As a new model of digital assets, the development, operation and promotion of Themis project will inevitably encounter such problems as technology, market cognition, policy supervision and many other unpredictable risks. Both Themis and GET are only present within the cyber virtual space, do not have any physical existence, and therefore do not belong to or relate to any particular country. In addition to the rest of the content described in this whitepaper, each GET purchaser should also read, understand and carefully consider the following risks described below before deciding whether to participate in this open sale plan. Participation in this open sale plan should be a decision after careful consideration and will be deemed to have been fully understood and agreed to by the purchaser with the risk described below.",
    risk_section_title1:"1.Token Sales Market Risk",
    risk_section_content1:"The GET open sale plan may be terminated early because the Token sales market environment is closely linked to the entire digital currency market situation, such as the overall market downturn, or other uncontrollable factors. At this point, the purchaser may only partially be refunded the amount paid due to the price volatility of Bitcoin or Ether and the expenses of the Themis Foundation.",
    risk_section_title2:"2.Insufficient Information Availability",
    risk_section_content2:"When the whitepaper releases, Themis is still at the stage of development, of which philosophy, consensus mechanisms, algorithms, code and other technical details and parameters may be updated and changed frequently and constantly. While this whitepaper has contained the most up-to-date key information of Themis, it is not absolutely complete and will still be continually adjusted and updated by the Themis team for specific purposes. Besides, it is unnecessary to provide the purchasers with every detail of Themis development, including its progress and expected milestones no matter whether rescheduled or not. It is inevitable and reasonable that the information disclosure is not enough.",
    risk_section_title3:"3.Regulatory Risks",
    risk_section_content3:"Because the blockchain is in the stage of development, there are still no unified laws and regulations related to the token crowd sale process, including prerequirements, transaction requirements, information disclosure requirements and file locking requirements. The blockchain technology and the crypto-tokens are being, or may be, overseen by the regulatory authorities of various jurisdictions. If some regulatory authorities intervene or exert influence on the project, the Themis Foundation may receive queries, notices, warnings, requests or rulings from one or more regulatory authorities from time to time, or may even be ordered to suspend or discontinue any action in connection with the Campaign, Themis’s development or GET. The development, marketing, promotion or otherwise of Themis or the GET crowdsale campaign may be seriously affected, hindered or terminated as a result. And since regulatory policies could change from time to time, existing regulatory permission or tolerance on Themis or the GET crowdsale campaign in any jurisdiction could be just temporary. GET could be defined from time to time as virtual commodity, digital asset or even securities or currency in various jurisdictions and therefore could be prohibited from being traded or held in certain jurisdictions pursuant to local regulatory requirements.",
    risk_section_title4:"4.Development Failure or Abortion",
    risk_section_content4:"Themis is still under development, rather than a finished product ready for release at any time. Due to the technical complexity of the Themis system, the Themis Foundation may face with unforeseeable and/or insurmountable difficulties from time to time. Accordingly, the development of Themis may fail or abort at any time for any cause (including lack of funds). Failure to develop or abandon the project would result in the inability to deliver the GET to any purchaser of this Crowdsale.",
    risk_section_title5:"5.Theft of Crowdsale Proceeds",
    risk_section_content5:"There may be attempts to steal the crowdsale proceeds received by the Themis Foundation (including the fiat currency amount converted therefrom). Such theft or attempted theft may affect the ability of the Themis Foundation to fund the development of Themis. While the Themis Foundation will adopt cutting-edge technical solutions to keep the crowdsale proceeds safe, certain cyber thefts can hardly be unpreventable.",
    risk_section_title6:" 6.Flaws in Source Code",
    risk_section_content6:"Because development on the blockchain is a challenging groundbreaking project, nobody can guarantee that the source code of Themis is flaw-free. It may contain some flaws, errors, defects and bugs, which may it impossible for users to use some specific, expose the users’ information or cause other problems. If  any such flaws arise, it will damage the availability, stability and security of Themis, and consequently will bring a negative impact on the value of GET. Open source codes rely on transparency to promote community-sourced identification and solution of problems within the code. The Themis Foundation will work closely together with the Themis community to keep improving, optimizing and perfecting the source code of Themis onwards.",
    risk_section_title7:"7.Risks of the Core Agreements",
    risk_section_content7:"Themis program is based on blockchain bottom protocols, and GET is developed based on ETH Token Stardard ERC20. If the bottom protocol of blockchain is subjected to some unpredictable functional issues or being attacked, it may cause the Themis platform and GET to stop working or cause loss of functionality in an unexpected way.",
    risk_section_title8:"8.System Risks",
    risk_section_content8:"The system risks refer to the negligible fatal flaws in open source software and the risks posed by large-scale failures of the global network infrastructures. Although some of these risks will be substantially reduced over time, such as by repairing vulnerabilities and breaking computational bottlenecks, other parts of the risks remain unpredictable, such as political factors or natural disasters that could lead to partial or global disruption of the Internet.",
    risk_section_title9:"9.Vulnerability or Cryptographic Risks",
    risk_section_content9:"The accelerated development of cryptography or technology, such as the development of quantum computers, might bring new risks to the Themis platform, which may lead to the loss of GET.",
    risk_section_title10:"10.Failure Risk of Applications",
    risk_section_content10:"Themis platform might not be able to provide services by variety of known or unknown reasons, e.g., large-scale of nodes down, and this might cause the loss of GET in severe cases.",

Any expectation or imagination of any participant in the function or form of Themis application or GET (including participant's behaviors) may not be met. Any kind of incorrect analysis or alteration of design might make this kind of things happen.",
    risk_section_title12:"12.Other Unexpected Risks",
    risk_section_content12:"Cryptographic Token is a completely new and untested technology, possibly suffering from some risks. Aside from those mentioned in this whitepaper, there are some risks that some founding teams have not mentioned or have not anticipated yet.
